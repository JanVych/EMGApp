# Electromyographic Signal Processing Application

This repository contains the source code for a **WinUI 3 desktop application** developed as part of a bachelor's thesis.  
The application is designed for **processing, visualization, and management of Electromyographic (EMG) signals**.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create a desktop application for measuring EMG signals.  
The EMG signal is amplified, fed into the computerâ€™s sound card, and processed mathematically inside the application.

### Features
- Configuration of measurement setup for different patients  
- Real-time display of measurement progress  
- Local database storage of patient information and measured EMG data  
- Retrospective review of past measurements  
- Tools for editing the patient database  

## Technologies
- C# / .NET  
- WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK)  
- SQLite (for database storage)
